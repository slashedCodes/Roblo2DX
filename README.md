# Roblo2DX

A 2D Game "Engine" for Roblox Studio.

Our goal is to introduce a new way to develop 2D games in Roblox.

We have seen people combine GUI's with actual Roblox models and combine hitboxes, we have seen people move the camera to the side for a 2D feeling.

But none of that is actually 2D, is it?

Roblo2DX Makes it easier for you and others to develop 2D games with Roblox's GUI.

# Usage

Import the Rojo project above in your Roblox game.
Enable loadstrings in ServerScriptService and you're done.
